# tf_sample

Sample usage of TF1 and TF2. This is aimed to assist the migration from TF1 to
TF2.

## Overview

The source code demonstrates the various operations that are commonly done
using TF. Namely, looking up transforms, broadcasting transforms, applying
a transform on a pose, converting RPY to quaternion and vice versa are
demonstrated.

Starting up `tf_sample_node.launch` will execute all the above mentioned
operations.
